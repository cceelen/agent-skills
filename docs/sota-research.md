# sota-research

`sota-research` is the tooling of the factory. It takes one major aspect of software
engineering from "what to build" to an accepted aspect specification and a rendered recipe
skill. A person stays in the loop: the owner decides what to build, confirms the sources and
accepts the result.

The tooling is in `factory/sota-research/`. Users of the kit do not install it.

## Before you start

- Install `uv`. The programs use the latest stable Python, and `uv` gets it.
- Work on the branch of the specification. The folder `specs/` is not on the branch `main`.

## The programs

Run each program with `uv run`. A program without an argument prints its usage text.

| Result code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The program is done. Nothing fails and nothing remains. |
| 1 | The program is done. Something fails or remains. The report tells you what. |
| 2 | The program cannot read its input. |
